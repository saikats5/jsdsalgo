Linear Search Solution

function linearSearch(arr, val){
    for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        if(arr[i] === val) return i;
    }
    return -1;
}

linearSearch([34,51,1,2,3,45,56,687], 100)

Big O -- On -- if the search item is on the end then it will search through the whole array which is the worst case


Binary Search

Rather than eliminating one element at a time, we can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
Binary search only works on sorted arrays
Divide and conquer

-Thi function accepts a sorted array and a value
-Create a left pointer at the start of the array, and a right pointer at the end of the array
-while the left pointer comes before the right pointer:
    -create a pointer in the middle
    -if you find the value you want, return the index
    -if the value is too small, move the left pointer up
    -if the value is too large, move the right pointer down
-if you never find the value, return -1
